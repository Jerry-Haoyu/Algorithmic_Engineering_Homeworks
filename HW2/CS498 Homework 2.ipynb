    "# Problem 1: Sherali–Adams & Maximum Independent Set\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **coding-only** problem. It will be autograded on Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement the **basic LP relaxation** for Maximum Independent Set (MIS) on an arbitrary graph.\n",
    "2. Understand why this basic LP can be **too weak** (gives an over-optimistic objective).\n",
    "3. Strengthen the LP by adding extra **odd-cycle inequalities** that make the relaxation much tighter.\n",
    "   - In the literature, these come from a “lift-and-project” procedure called the\n",
    "     **Sherali–Adams hierarchy**, but for this problem, you only need to understand them\n",
    "     as **extra valid inequalities** that improve and strengthens the LP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Input: Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The autograder will pass a graph to your function as a **NumPy adjacency matrix**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `adj` is a `numpy.ndarray` of shape `(n, n)`.\n",
    "- `adj[i, j] = 1` if there is an edge between vertices `i` and `j`, otherwise `0`.\n",
    "- The graph is:\n",
    "  - **Undirected**: `adj[i, j] == adj[j, i]`\n",
    "  - **Simple**: `adj[i, i] = 0` (no self-loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example helper (you don’t need to write this; the autograder will):\n",

    "## Decision Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "For a graph with vertices $V = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, we introduce one variable per vertex:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $x_i \\in [0, 1]$ for each vertex $i \\in V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $x_i = 1$: we choose vertex $i$ (room $i$ is in the independent set).\n",
    "* $x_i = 0$: we don’t choose vertex $i$.\n",
    "* Fractional values (like $x_i = 0.4$) are allowed in the LP relaxation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part A – The Basic MIS LP Relaxation (for any graph)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Maximum Independent Set** problem asks for the largest set of vertices with no edges inside the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We model a **fractional relaxation** with this LP:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\max \\quad & \\sum_{i} x_i \\\n",
    "\\text{s.t.} \\quad & x_i + x_j \\le 1 \\quad \\text{for each edge } (i, j), \\\n",
    "& 0 \\le x_i \\le 1 \\quad \\text{for all } i.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this reasonable?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The constraint $x_i + x_j \\le 1$ prevents us from simultaneously setting $x_i = x_j = 1$ on an edge,\n",
    "  which would violate independence.\n",
    "* The bounds $0 \\le x_i \\le 1$ ensure the variables are between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is only a **relaxation**: it allows fractional solutions that are not valid independent sets.\n",
    "On some graphs, the LP optimum can be strictly **larger** than the true maximum independent set size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part B – Why the Basic LP Can Be Too Weak: The 5-Cycle Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the **5-cycle** $C_5$: vertices $0, 1, 2, 3, 4$ in a ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The true maximum independent set size on $C_5$ is **2**.\n",
    "* But the basic LP has an optimal solution with all $x_i = 0.5$:\n",
    "  * Each edge constraint: $x_i + x_j = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1$, so it is feasible.\n",
    "  * Objective value: $\\sum_i x_i = 5 \\cdot 0.5 = 2.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the LP says \"2.5 rooms\". The relaxation is **too optimistic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part C – Strengthening the LP by Adding More Inequalities\n",
    "\n",
    "One standard way to improve an LP relaxation is to add more **valid inequalities**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An inequality is *valid* if **every** true independent set (with $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$) satisfies it.\n",
    "* If an inequality is valid but **violated** by some fractional LP solution, then adding it will\n",
    "  **cut off** that bad fractional solution and make the relaxation tighter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Odd-Cycle Inequality\n",
    "\n",
    "On the 5-cycle, it is impossible to choose **3** vertices without picking two adjacent ones, so no independent set can have three vertices in the cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be expressed as the inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_0 + x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 \\le 2.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every independent set satisfies this (maximum of 2 vertices in a 5-cycle).\n",
    "* The fractional solution with all $x_i = 0.5$ **violates** it (sum = 2.5).\n",
    "* If we **add** this inequality to the LP, the optimum drops from 2.5 down to 2, which matches the true integral answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what we mean by **strengthening** the LP: adding more inequalities that are\n",
    "true for all 0–1 solutions, but remove some fractional ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Odd-Cycle Inequalities\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, for any **odd cycle** $C$ of length $|C|$ in a graph, we can add:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i \\in C} x_i \\le \\frac{|C| - 1}{2}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In any independent set on an odd cycle of length $|C|$,\n",
    "  you can pick at most $\\frac{|C| - 1}{2}$ vertices.\n",
    "* So this inequality is valid for all **0–1** solutions.\n",
    "* But it often cuts off fractional solutions of the basic LP.\n",
    "\n",
    "These inequalities can be derived systematically using a \"lift-and-project\" method called\n",
    "the **Sherali–Adams hierarchy**. For this problem however, you do **not** need to know the full\n",
    "theory, just think of them as **extra constraints** that make the LP closer to the true\n",
    "combinatorial problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part D – Using NetworkX to Find Odd Cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "We’d like to automatically find all cycles in the graph and add these odd-cycle inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use **NetworkX**, a Python graph library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing NetworkX (on your machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "On your own machine, you can install NetworkX with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install networkx\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> On Gradescope, `networkx` will already be installed in the autograder environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building a Graph from the Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside your solution file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import networkx as nx\n",
    "\n",
    "def build_graph_from_adj(adj):\n",
    "    # adj is a numpy array of shape (n, n)\n",
    "    G = nx.from_numpy_array(adj)  # undirected simple graph\n",
    "    return G\n",

    "\n",
    "* Creates an undirected NetworkX graph.\n",
    "* Nodes are labeled `0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n",
    "* An edge `(i, j)` is added whenever `adj[i, j] != 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Listing Simple Cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "NetworkX can produce a **cycle basis** of the graph. A basis for cycles of a network is a minimal collection of cycles such that any cycle in the network can be written as a sum of cycles in the basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "G = build_graph_from_adj(adj)\n",
    "cycles = nx.cycle_basis(G)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `cycles` is a list of simple cycles.\n",
    "* Each cycle is a list of vertices (no repeated start/end vertex).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example for a 5-cycle: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each cycle `C` in `cycles`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If `len(C)` is **odd**, we add the linear inequality\n",
    "  $\\sum_{i \\in C} x_i \\le (|C| - 1)/2$.\n",

    "## What You Should Observe\n",
    "\n",
    "Run your code (or check Gradescope feedback) on different graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Triangle** $K_3$:\n",
    "  * Basic LP optimum ≈ 1.5 (using $x_i = 0.5$).\n",
    "  * Odd-cycle inequality for the triangle $\\sum x_i \\le 1$ forces the optimum down to 1.\n",

    "* **4-cycle** $C_4$:\n",
    "  * There are **no odd cycles**, so there are no extra inequalities to add.\n",
    "  * The strengthened LP equals the basic LP; the objective values should match.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these cases, you’re seeing the same phenomenon: by **strengthening the LP with valid inequalities** (here, odd-cycle inequalities), you push the LP solution closer to the true combinatorial answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core idea behind hierarchies like **Sherali–Adams**, they systematically generate families of such inequalities to **tighten** relaxations. Can you think of other inequalities that would tighten MIS for the clique for example? (not for submission)"
